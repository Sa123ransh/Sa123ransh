Question: Calculate the area of a circle and modify the same program to calculate the volume of cylinder given its radius and height
#include <stdio.h>

int main(){
    int radius = 3;
    float pi = 3.14;
    printf (" the area of this circle is %f",pi*radius*radius);
    int height = 3;
    printf (" volume of this cylinder is %f",pi*radius*radius*height);
    return 0;
}
